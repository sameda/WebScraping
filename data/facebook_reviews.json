I will begin with the positives -- the ambience and decor of the dining room are beautiful. The menu options were creative and varied. The food that we eventually were served was excellent. My husband and I had the roasted carrot salad. We shared appetizers in lieu of an entree -- he had the terrine. I had the chicken fried quail. Our friends had cod and the cauliflower steak, as well as the pea soup.

The CIA campus is beautiful but where the restaurants are is so pretty with a pavilion and water feature outside. The entrance is very grand with a long hallway leading to the various restaurants. American bounty itself has a bar at the entrance which would be good if you arrive early or have to wait for your table for some reason. Luckily we did not have to wait and were taken to our table even though we arrived al...\n\nSee More","starRating":"5 star","recommendation":"Louise Feldman reviewed American Bounty ‚Äî \n5 star","averageRating":0},{"fullName":"Michael Golub","postDate":"February 21","postReview":"Excellent service and fantastic dinner","starRating":"","recommendation":"Michael Golub  recommends American Bounty.","averageRating":0},{"fullName":"Jessica Joy Smith","postDate":"May 16, 2017","postReview":"Had potential but service wasn't great. Went with my Mom and Grandma the day before Mother's Day for lunch. Took over 30 minutes for a server to even take our order and bring us drinks. They wouldnt have brought us bread if we didnt ask them. Forgot part of our appetizers and brought it with our entrees. Grandma's duck was very fatty and rarer than she expected and when she asked for the fat to be cooked down it was barely re-seared. I know the students are learning but I'm comparing it to other Culinary campus restaurants and we had a much better experience at Bocuse. I expected a better experience.","starRating":"","recommendation":"Jessica Joy Smith reviewed American Bounty ‚Äî \n3 star","averageRating":0},{"fullName":"Elizabeth Pfeufer Knapp","postDate":"January 24","postReview":"Food was great!

The food was excellent. We had scallops. Just wonderful. Being in a group, we had to sit at seperate tables, with people who were not friends or family. The student who was helping with seating never smiled and was not helpful at all. Her personality should not be in Customer Service at all. She did not know how to deal with people. I hope she chooses back of house for her career path. But the food? Outstanding. Our young girl, student, who served our table was excellent. I feel with bus groups they could know ahead of time the number of people in each group and accommodate people so they can sit with friends and family, not strangers.","starRating":"5 star","recommendation":"Marlene Levin reviewed American Bounty ‚Äî \n5 star","averageRating":0},{"fullName":"Pat Port","postDate":"November 20, 2018","postReview":"Excellent meals were enjoyed by five of us celebrating my granddaughter‚Äôs birthday!

The extra pale was far too hopped for style. The wit also was far too hopped for style and lacked the smooth mouthfeel indicative of contemporaries like Celis.

I wanted to wait a few days to see if my impression of the food changed even a tiny bit but it hasn't. I did not ask anyone else at the table about their opinion but no one offered any positive comments regarding their meal. So, this review is my experience solely.

I ordered my steak medium; pink on the inside, it came out raw; purple in color, finally when our young waiter returned, the other three people at my table were almost done with their meal, I asked for it to be cooked to medium, fifteen minutes later the steak was returned exactly as raw as it had been the first time. I then asked for it to go, along with my onion rings. After receiving a ticket to go down a hallway to get my leftovers; only then to find my onion rings missing.
